                    In 1989, the MR2 underwent a significant transformation. 
                        The new SW20 iteration boasted a larger, more luxurious cabin, 
                        sacrificing some weight for increased passenger comfort. 
                        This was balanced by upgrades to the engine and drivetrain for 
                        continued performance. Toyota remained dedicated to the MR2's 
                        handling prowess, refining the suspension with input from racing
                        experts. The SW20's design also took a turn, adopting sleeker, more 
                        rounded lines that drew comparisons to Ferraris, earning it nicknames
                        like "baby Ferrari" or "poor man's Ferrari." While rumors of a powerful
                        V6 version to rival the Ferrari 348 swirled during development, Toyota 
                        ultimately stuck with a four-cylinder engine, suggesting a potential V6 
                        might find its home under the Lexus brand. Overall, the 1989 MR2 redesign 
                        offered an evolution, balancing luxury and performance.
