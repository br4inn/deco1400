                            The first MR2, launched in 1984, was a lightweight and well-handling 2-seater sports car.
                            It was known for its mid-engine layout and nimble performance, thanks in part to help from
                            Lotus engineers during development. The most common version came with a 1.6-liter engine 
                            and a 5-speed manual transmission, offering a 0-60 mph time in the 8-second range. In 1986,
                            a supercharged version was introduced, boosting horsepower to 145 hp and accelerating from 
                            0-100 km/h in under 7 seconds. This model was exclusive to Japan and North America.
