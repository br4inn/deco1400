                        The Toyota MR2 AW11, often fondly referred to as the "AW11," stands as an iconic representative of Toyota's engineering prowess and commitment to delivering an exhilarating driving experience. Introduced in 1984, the AW11 was the first generation of the MR2 series, setting the benchmark for compact, mid-engine sports cars.
            
                        At the heart of the AW11 lies its mid-engine layout, which enhances its balance and agility, making it a joy to drive on winding roads and tight corners. This configuration, combined with its lightweight construction, offers remarkable handling characteristics that have delighted driving enthusiasts for decades.
            
                        The AW11 was available with a range of engines, including the rev-happy 1.6-liter 4A-GE inline-four engine, which became legendary for its performance and reliability. Paired with either a manual or automatic transmission, the AW11 delivered an engaging driving experience, with precise shifting and responsive throttle.
            
                        Despite its compact dimensions, the AW11 boasted a well-designed interior that provided comfort and convenience for its occupants. Its futuristic design cues, including pop-up headlights and sleek body lines, added to its appeal and contributed to its timeless aesthetic.
            
                        Over the years, the MR2 AW11 has garnered a dedicated following among automotive enthusiasts worldwide, thanks to its blend of performance, handling, and reliability. Whether carving through mountain roads or navigating city streets, the AW11 continues to captivate drivers with its spirited performance and timeless charm.

The intake camshaft valve cover now highlights 16 Valve in red. EGR port repositioning on the exhaust manifold aims to prevent cracking, while manual transmission internals have been revised. The air filter has been rerouted to the trunk, continuing around towards the air vent on the opposite side of the engine bay. Chassis adjustments feature slight unibody modifications and a radiator tilted back to channel air downwards. Rear suspension has been revised, and brake rotors increased to 258 mm front and 262 mm rear. New tail lights, front lip, and bumper enhance aesthetics, with the radio antenna relocated to the rear right quarter panel for t-top/sunroof models. Interior updates include a shift of the parking brake for LHD models, a new center console and armrest, and a glovebox lock. Additionally, a double-din radio and rear speakers are added to the upper C pillar, along with changes to door panels, steering wheel, gauge cluster markings, and seat design to single-color velour with perforations for leather seats')">

                        'The transition from the MY 1986 to MY 1987 model years brought about several significant upgrades to the vehicles design and functionality. One notable change was the replacement of T-bar glass panels, shifting from smoked (clear) to mirrored (opaque) finish, enhancing both aesthetic appeal and privacy for occupants. Moreover, a uniform color-coding of door handles and side mirrors across all models contributed to a cohesive and sophisticated exterior appearance. The traditional incandescent third brake lamp was replaced with a modern LED strip integrated into the rear spoiler, improving visibility and safety on the road. Additionally, the introduction of more aerodynamic wing mirrors, along with the optional power retract mechanism, underscored a commitment to both style and practicality. In terms of performance enhancements, North American supercharged models were equipped with a rear anti-roll bar, enhancing stability and handling during spirited driving. However, the transition between MY 1986 and MY 1987 models was gradual, with some early MY 1987 cars retaining elements of the previous MY 1986 design, such as the flat front bumper. Similarly, variations in engine components and suspension configurations were observed, reflecting production adjustments and part availability during the transition period')">

                    American car magazines Road & Track and Car and Driver both esteemed the MR2 highly, placing it on their "ten best" car lists. Across the Pacific, the Australian Wheels magazine hailed the 1988 MR2 as its favored sports car. Notably, the MR2 clinched the title of Motor Trend's Import Car of the Year for 1985. Its consistent excellence earned it a spot on Car and Driver magazine's Ten Best list for both 1986 and 1987. Even years later, in 2004, Sports Car International recognized the MR2, ranking it at number eight among the Top Sports Cars of the 1980s.

                    In the later years of production, Toyota released two exclusive "Super Edition" MR2s, available only in Japan and based on the supercharged Japanese market model. The 1988 iteration, limited to 300 units, boasted a distinctive white/gold two-tone paint scheme, bronze glass, and a unique interior featuring half-leather and half-cloth seats. It also sported a MOMO-commissioned steering wheel and gear knob. Following its success, the 1989 model, limited to 270 units, featured an exquisite Midnight Blue paint job, along with Recaro "Milano" seats and matching door panels. Continuing the trend of luxury, it also incorporated elements from the G-Limited model, such as the LED rear spoiler brake light and more aerodynamic wing mirrors. Each "Super Edition" model proudly displayed unique decals on the rear visor and side stripes, adding to their exclusivity and allure.
